# DrumMachine


Just a little drum machine using html to practice audio elements and see what can be done with them. 

With HTML 5 you can't trigger the same audio file from one button until the audio has finsihed playing. 

This is an issue for a drum machine. 

Javascript required for more functionality. 

Still a good excersise. will update at a  later date.
